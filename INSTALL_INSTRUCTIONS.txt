Installation

1.  Download the release zip file 
2.  Unpack it somewhere.  
		The zip file will contain a folder called KSPLocalizer. 
		The entire folder should be copied locally.
		The actual location doesn't matter.

3.  There are two small utility files in the folder:
		localizer.cmd  (for use on Windows)
		localizer.sh   (for use on Mac or Linux)

	These are intended to make it easier to use without having to change 
	the PATH variable.

4.  If on Linux or Mac only:
	Run the following commands to make the file executable:

		cd KSPLocalizer
		chmod -x *
		chmod 755 localizer.sh
		dos2unix  localizer.sh

5.  Edit the appropriate script file and set the path to the program.
